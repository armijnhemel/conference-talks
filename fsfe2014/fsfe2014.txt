Slides of two talks talk I gave at FSFE's Legal & Licensing Workshop in 2014. Originally this talk was under Chatham House Rule.

First talk was about build tracing. Later the same subject was also covered at ASE 2014 in September 2014:

The second talk was about the OSADL license compliance audit.
