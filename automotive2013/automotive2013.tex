\frametitle{Binary Analysis Tool}
Binary Analysis Tool (or: BAT) is a lightweight tool under an open source license that automates binary analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item demystify compliance engineering by codifying knowledge
\item make it easier to have reproducable results
\item common language for binary analysis
\item only analyses binaries, but draws no legal conclusions
\end{itemize}

Although BAT is a generic framework for binary analysis my focus is on software license compliance.

Important: a license violation is not a technical issue, but a legal issue. Technical measures are only used to obtain evidence.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Why analyse binaries?}

\begin{itemize}
\item software is often supplied in binary form by vendors (on a device/CD/DVD/flash chip/download/app). Sometimes source code is supplied and if you're lucky it matches the binary.
\item binaries are shipped to customers
\end{itemize}

Shipping software as source code is the \textit{exception}.

If you pass on the binary software (for example in a product) you have to know what you ship! This means you have to analyse the binaries.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Place of BAT in an open source compliance process}
BAT is not meant as a replacement of a source code scanner: if you have all source code there is more than enough information to work with and you don't necessarily need BAT.

BAT is useful when:

\begin{itemize}
\item you get binaries, but no source code and want to know what could be in there
\item you get binaries and source code, but don't know if binaries and sources match
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Binary analysis}
A binary usually looks like a blob with random data. Often there is a structure,
with embedded file systems or compressed files that can ``easily'' be recognized.  
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Analysis steps}
Steps to determine if a binary contains a particular source code:

\begin{enumerate}
\item extract binary files from blobs (firmwares, installers, etc.) recursively (if needed)
\item extract identifiers (strings, function names, variable names, etcetera) from binary files and compare these to (publicly available) source code
\item use other information like file names, presence of other files, package databases, etcetera, for circumstantial evidence
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{``Ducktyping''}
``If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck''

If you can relate many strings, function names, variable names, and so on from a binary file to source code it becomes statistically hard to deny (re)use of a certain software.

Often it is possible to match hundreds or even thousands of strings, function/method names or variable names.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Drawbacks of manual inspection}
Checking can be done by hand using standard Linux tools, but there are drawbacks:

\begin{itemize}
\item limited by the knowledge of the engineer
\item time consuming (so expensive)
\item easy to overlook things
\end{itemize}

So you really want to automate this! BAT can do this for you.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Inner workings of BAT}

\begin{enumerate}
\item discovery of offsets of known file systems and compressed files and unpacking of found file systems and compressed files (recursively)
\item check each unpacked file, like identifier search
\item reporting, generating pictures, etcetera
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{BAT modules}

BAT is extremely modular and it comes with several modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item unpacking over 30 file systems and compressed files
\item report on common properties (file type, size, etcetera)
\item search for license markers and identifiers
\item advanced string identifier search
\item dynamic ELF linking verification
\item kernel module analysis
\item many more
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Advanced identifier search/ranking}
Most advanced check in BAT extracts string constants, function/method names, variable names, etcetera, from binaries and compares them with a large database of strings and function names extracted from source code:

Currently over 170,000 packages from GNU, GNOME, KDE, Samba, Debian, Savannah, FedoraHosted, Linux kernel, Maven, \dots

Database is not part of BAT, but only available as a subscription, or you can ``roll your own''.

Algorithm has been published at the Mining Software Repositories 2011 conference and scripts to create the database are open.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Demo with BAT}
Running a test would take too long for this presentation, so I will only browse pregenerated results.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Inner workings of BAT ranking}
BAT ranking algorithm uses a database where data is extracted from \textit{source code}:

\begin{itemize}
\item string constants (using \texttt{xgettext})
\item function names (C) and method names (Java) (using \texttt{ctags})
\item variable names and Linux kernel symbols (C), field names and class names (Java) (using \texttt{ctags})
\item licenses (if enabled) (using Ninka and FOSSology)
\item various characteristics of the file (SHA256 checksum, etc.)
\end{itemize}

Core of algorithm uses string constants, rest of information is used to verify/strengthen the findings.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{String extraction from binaries}
From each binary that has not yet been discarded (graphics, video, audio, resources files and text files are not interesting) string constants are extracted.

String constants are used because they are not discarded by the compiler.

Some preprocessing steps can be used to increase quality of the strings extracted (to avoid false positives and get better scan results).

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Scoring (1)}
Each binary file is sorted into a family of languages:

\begin{itemize}
\item C (C/C++/QML/etc. + unknown binaries)
\item Java (JDK/Dalvik/Scala/etc.)
\item C\#
\item ActionScript
\end{itemize}

Reason is that strings that are very insignficant in one family could be very significant in another and vice versa.

Drawback: language embedding (specifically .NET) is at odds with this. For most systems (Java, embedded Linux) this is much less of an issue.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Scoring (2)}
Each string constant is compared to the database. If a string can be matched a score is assigned to that string.

The score for a unique string (single package) is the length of the string.

If it is not unique the score very rapidly drops depending on in how many different packages it can be found.

If there is \textit{cloning} the string is assigned to a package using an algorithm that picks the most promising package.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Database challenges}
There are challenges in creating a database:

\begin{itemize}
\item package names and file names are very important in BAT. DVCS like Git make software development more fluid.
\item cloning of software between packages.
%\item current implementation assigns non-unique matches to largest package, which is sometimes incorrect (for example: assign strings from \texttt{zlib} to \texttt{icedove}). This will be fixed in newer versions.
\end{itemize}

These challenges are not exclusive to BAT.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Cloning}
Sometimes the wrong package will be detected, but this reflects how open source works!

\begin{itemize}
\item software reuse: code is ``cloned'' between packages. Software reuse is actually good! Some packages are forked and incoporated into others (in Java more so than in C code).
\item packages are renamed for various reasons. For example in Debian: \texttt{httpd} is renamed to \texttt{apache2}, Firefox is Iceweasel, and so on.
\end{itemize}

BAT tries to take alternatives and ``cloning'' into account.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Database quality}
Results of scanning are dependent on quality of the database: if only BusyBox is included everything will look like BusyBox. Making a good database is not easy:

\begin{itemize}
\item What to include?
\item What to exclude?
\item When is a package a new package?
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Other functionality in BAT}

\begin{itemize}
\item finding duplicate files in firmwares
\item finding leftover kernel modules (mismatching kernel version numbers)
\item ELF dynamic linking dependency inspection
\item and more
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{ELF dynamic linking}
Actual license of a binary is only determined at \textit{run time}. This is a
largely unresearched area.

BAT can give more information about how ELF binary files interact.

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Upcoming functionality in BAT}

\begin{itemize}
\item better GUI
\item deployment as a webservice
\item more file systems: vendors often use non-standard versions of file systems. Right now BAT supports 14 different flavours of squashfs and I \textit{know} there are more.
