\frametitle{Subjects}

Today you will learn:

\begin{itemize}
\item backgrounds of GPL compliance engineering
\item identifying compressed files and file systems within a bigger binary blob
\item extracting and verifying compressed files and file systems
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{What is GPL compliance engineering?}
GPL compliance engineering is finding out what is inside a firmware blob to see if any GPL licensed code was used, plus seeing if license conditions are met.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Supply chain}
It is very uncommon for a company to do all the work on a product. Parts (including software) are bought from a \textit{supply chain} and combined and redistributed.

Supply chains can be long and often one or more companies screw up and distribute components license incompliant, exposing companies further down in the chain to significant legal risk.

Example: in consumer electronics the companies at the end of the supply chain carry the most/all risk, but have no say about the choices made by the other companies.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{A warning before we start}
It is important to keep in mind that the methods outlined below are only for finding evidence. Whether or not someone violates a license is a legal question, not a technical one. It is easy to jump to incorrect conclusions. Interpretation of legal results should be done by legal professionals, not engineers.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{GPL compliance engineering process}

\begin{itemize}
\item extract programs from blobs (firmwares, installers, etc.)
\item extract human readable strings from binaries and compare this to (publicly available) source code
\item (if possible) extract function names from binaries and compare this to (publicly available) source code
\item use other information like file names, other files, etc. for circumstantial evidence
\end{itemize}

If you can relate enough (unique) strings and/or function names from a binary file to source code it becomes statistically hard to deny (re)use of software.

\frametitle{Binary analysis}
A firmware seems to be a blob with random data. Often there is a structure.
Steps needed for binary analysis are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item find file systems and compressed files
\item unpack them
\item research unpacked files, goto 1 if needed
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Obtaining binary files}
Downloadable firmwares are not enough for a \textit{complete} analysis of a device:

\begin{itemize}
\item not all software that is on the device is in the firmware (bootloader, recovery partition, etc.)
\item firmware might be encrypted
\item no firmware might be available for download
\end{itemize}

Via other methods (serial port, JTAG, security holes) you might need to gain access to the device to get
access to the full contents of the flash chip.

Obtaining firmwares via these methods is out of scope for this course, we use a complete firmware.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Firmware used in this course}
We use one firmware in this course:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trendnet TEW-636ABP
\item corresponding source code
\end{itemize}

These are on the USB stick. Please note: the firmware and source code are GPL incompliant, so please don't redistribute.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Compliance engineering}

\begin{itemize}
\item discovery of offsets
\item unpacking of file systems
\item analysis of binaries
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Discovery of offsets}
Two clear indicators where compressed files or file systems can start:

\begin{itemize}
\item known identifiers
\item padding
\end{itemize}

Displaying files in a readable format, for example with \texttt{hexdump}, is very helpful for manual analysis.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{\texttt{hexdump}}

\texttt{hexdump} is a great tool for displaying files in hexadecimal format.

The switch \texttt{-C} displays three columns:

\begin{enumerate}
\item hexadecimal offset in the file
\item hexadecimal value of bytes
\item human readable representation of bytes
\end{enumerate}

\texttt{hexdump -C \$file | less}

{\scriptsize\color{blue}{
\begin{verbatim}
00000000  48 44 52 30 00 10 21 00  0a 07 eb 3d 00 00 01 00  |HDR0..!....=....|

\end{verbatim}
}}
\end{frame}

\frame{
\frametitle{Known identifiers}
Many compressed files and file systems start, or end, with identifiers, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item the string \texttt{PK} for ZIP files
\item the string \texttt{ELF} for ELF files
\item the hexadecimal sequence \texttt{0x1f 0x8b 0x08} for gzip compression
\end{itemize}

Many identifiers are well documented, for example in \texttt{/usr/share/magic} or file specifications. In practice only a few file systems and compressed files are in widespread use.

Some identifiers are very generic and false positives are likely to occur so you always need some verification step.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Padding in firmwares}
Firmwares are typically written to flash memory. The bootloader on devices is often configured with offsets for:

\begin{itemize}
\item start of file systems
\item start of bootloader
\item location of (compressed) kernel
\item etcetera
\end{itemize}

There is often not enough data to completely fill the allocated space, so \textit{padding} is used, usually NUL characters.
{\scriptsize\color{blue}{
\begin{verbatim}
0007b130  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
\end{verbatim}
}}

You can look for padding in a firmware file and search around it for identifiers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Recognizing padding}
\texttt{hexdump} will compress duplicate lines and replace them with \texttt{*}:

{\scriptsize\color{blue}{
\begin{verbatim}
0007b130  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
*
0007b400  68 73 71 73 06 02 00 00  e0 05 62 0f 3f 00 00 00  |hsqs......b.?...|
\end{verbatim}
}}

Large amounts of NUL characters often indicate a partition boundary.

For example, in the example above the padding is followed by a SquashFS file system.

Or, we can visualise it!
\end{frame}

\frame{
\frametitle{Excercise 1: discover offsets}

Copy the firmware (\texttt{TEW-636APB-1002.bin}) to a temporary directory and do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item use \texttt{hexdump -C} to display the contents of the file. You might want to use a pager like \texttt{less}, or redirect output to a file for later inspection.
\item report likely offsets for gzip compressed file and SquashFS file system you found.
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Extracting files}
After finding the right offsets you need to carve out the file system or compressed file from the firmware. There are a few ways to do this and depends on personal preference:

\begin{itemize}
\item editor that can process binary files (vim, emacs, etcetera)
\item \texttt{dd}
\end{itemize}

Example with \texttt{dd}:

\texttt{dd if=/path/to/firmware of=/path/to/outfile bs=\$offset skip=1}

Please note that \texttt{\$offset} has to be in decimal, not in hexadecimal, so you might need to convert it first.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example: gzip}
Firmware has a gzip file at offset \texttt{0x1C}. Remove the bytes in front:

\texttt{dd if=/path/to/firmware of=/path/to/outfile bs=28 skip=1}

and verify using \texttt{file} that the file is actually a gzip file:

\begin{verbatim}
$ file /path/to/outfile 
/path/to/outfile: gzip compressed data, from Unix,
    max compression
\end{verbatim}

Then you can unpack using \texttt{zcat}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ zcat /path/to/outfile > /path/to/outfile2
gzip: /path/to/outfile: decompression OK,
    trailing garbage ignored
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\frame{
\frametitle{Excercise 2: extract, verify and unpack files}
Extract the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item gzip compressed file at offset \texttt{0x0030060}
\item SquashFS file system (find the offset yourself). Use \texttt{unsquashfs} to extract this file system.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Automated extraction using the Binary Analysis Tool}
Manually extracting files is a lot of work and it is easy to miss files. The Binary Analysis Tool automates extraction:

\begin{itemize}
\item search for identifiers
\item extraction and verification
\end{itemize}

BAT works recursively and can unpack nested files and file systems.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Running BAT}
First make sure BAT plus all necessary dependencies are installed. Then run:

\texttt{bruteforce.py -c /path/to/configuration -b /path/to/firmware -o /path/to/resultfile > /path/to/redirect/stdout}

The mandatory parameters are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{-c} is the path to a configuration file for BAT
\item \texttt{-b} is the path to the binary file that needs to be scanned
\item \texttt{-o} is the path to an output file (TAR file which will contain unpacked file tree, plus results)
\end{itemize}

By default a XML result file is written to standard output. This can be redirected to a file for later inspection.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Using the BAT viewer to interpret results}
To review results the BAT viewer can be used. The BAT viewer (called \texttt{batgui}) reads output the TAR output files generated by \texttt{bruteforce.py}.

\texttt{batgui} is written in wxPython.

A word of warning: result files can become rather large and unpacking results can be slow.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Exercise 3: run BAT and interpret results}
Run BAT on the test firmware and confirm:

\begin{itemize}
\item you found a gzip compressed kernel and a squashfs file system
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Conclusion}

\item backgrounds of the Binary Analysis Tool
\item identifying compressed files and file systems within a bigger binary blob
\item extracting and verifying compressed files and file systems
\item configuring and using the Binary Analysis Tool to extract and verify compressed files and file systems
