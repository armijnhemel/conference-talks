In some cases some sensitive information was removed and the PDF file was regenerated:

* opencompliancesummit2014/opencompliance2014.pdf

All other files are the original slides.

Some of the talks might mention the names of companies. It should be noted that many of the companies that are mentioned in a GPL compliance context have started to become better. The fact that they are mentioned does not mean that their current products have defects, or are free of defects.
