\frame{
\frametitle{Subjects}

\begin{itemize}
\item license enforcement across the world
\item cause of license violations in consumer electronics
\item short overview of tooling and processes
\end{itemize}

I will not talk about software patents.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{License enforcement}

\begin{itemize}
\item Europe (Germany, France) \& USA
\item focus is on GPLv2 and LGPLv2/2.1
\item done by companies (Nokia, Red Hat) and individual developers (Harald Welte, BusyBox, etc.)
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Reactions from companies}
Companies are often quite mad when confronted:

\begin{itemize}
\item dispute the license (``but it's free!'')
\item they have done everything in good faith (``go to my supplier, it's their fault'')
\item no clue about their own responsibility (``but the competitor is doing it too!'')
\end{itemize}

Bummer.

\frame{
\frametitle{Background about violations}

Everyone makes mistakes, but mistakes need to be fixed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item understand
\item acknowledge
\item fix
\item prevent
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Consumer electronics: the truth}
Almost everything is purchased pre-fab in Asia. Making everything yourself is commercial suicide:

\begin{itemize}
\item extremely thin margins
\item cut throat competition
\item quality is less important than price
\item ``cowboys''
\end{itemize}

It's like Nike: don't do any production, just marketing and sales.

\frame{
\frametitle{Problem source: supply chain}
License violations are often a direct result of a mistake made in the supply chain:

\begin{itemize}
\item chipset vendors
\item board makers
\item SDK (``Software Development Kit'') vendor
\item reference design makers
\item product customizers
\item ``labellers''
\end{itemize}

The roles are not always very clearly separated. The ``labellers'' are legally
responsible.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Experiences with Asia}

Barriers:

\begin{itemize}
\item copyright works differently
\item cultural barriers
\item NDAs were mandatory for years, now source code is demanded
\item GPLv2 is in English
\item GPL code is seen as ``public domain''
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Experiences with Asia (2)}

\begin{itemize}
\item low risk getting caught, so why bother?
\item ``best practices'' are not applied: development processes are often quite sloppy
\item everything is short term
\item engineers switch companies fast, especially in Taiwan
\item competitors also don't follow licenses and ``save'' money
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{How can we improve the situation in Asia (and here)?}

``Put your money where your mouth is''

\begin{itemize}
\item education
\item economic pressure
\item tools
\item research
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Education}
It's a people problem, not a technical problem!

\begin{itemize}
\item talks
\item articles
\item documentation in local languages (at the moment traditional Chinese)
\item help local organisations (for example: OpenFoundry in Taiwan)
\item train more compliance engineers
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Economic pressure}

\begin{itemize}
\item more legal cases in Europe and USA
\item convince companies to use contracts to push the problem into the supply chain
\end{itemize}

Non-compliance becomes more expensive, so there is a better incentive for companies to comply.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Tools}

Goal: let companies do these checks themselves.

\begin{itemize}
\item Binary Analysis Tool (ask me for a demo)
\item integrating license scanners (Ninka, FOSSology) into (development) processes
\item long term: more tooling
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Academic research}

There is a lot of unclarity about licenses, so we need more research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding Software License Violations Through Binary Code Clone Detection (Mining Software Repositories 2011)
\item What Goes into an Executable? Identifying a Binary's Sources by Tracing Build Processes (sent to ICSE 2012, not yet accepted)
\item future research
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Results}
The situation is improving. More and more companies are learning how to deal with Open Source Software, but slowly.

We have noticed that in Asia there is more interest in correctly following licenses.

Expectation: enough work for the coming 10 years
